Summary and explanation of this application and related database and PHP code implementation:

  The purpose of this DB was to build a Back Office Admin operations portal for a “Car Rental Company” where admin user can create, update, delete  stores, cars and employees and assign inventory to related branches. 
  
  An admin user can also run combination of multiple reports  for monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually projected earnings for each store based on average occupancy estimation.
